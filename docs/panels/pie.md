# Pie Chart Panel Configuration

The Pie chart panel visualizes data as a pie or donut chart, useful for showing proportions of a whole.

## A Poem for the Proportion Perfectionists

_For those who love a good slice of data:_

```text
They say you can't have it all—
Pie charts beg to differ, y'all!
Round and round the data goes,
Each slice sized by what it shows.

Who's got the biggest piece of pie?
Just look—it catches every eye.
Donut hole? Small, medium, large?
Pick your style; you're in charge.

"Inside" or "auto" for the labels,
"Percent" values—crisp and stable.
Legend positioned left or right,
Colors keeping categories bright.

From traffic sources to error types,
Status codes and payment stripes—
Your data served up, fresh and whole:
Every slice helps reach your goal!
```
