# Markdown Panel Configuration

The `markdown` panel type is used to display rich text content, formatted using Markdown syntax, directly on your dashboard. This is equivalent to the "Text" visualization in Kibana.

## A Poem for the Documentation Devotees

_For those who believe every dashboard needs context:_

```text
# Bold headers and *italic* flair,
- Bullet lists with items to share,
[Links](that take you anywhere),
Markdown panels handle with care!

When charts alone won't tell the tale,
And metrics need context to prevail,
You write instructions, notes, and more,
To help users understand the score.

"## Welcome to this Dashboard space!"
"Please follow these steps with grace!"
Font size twelve or twenty-four,
Open a new tab, or replace this bore.

From setup guides to troubleshooting tips,
Important warnings, helpful quips,
Your markdown keeps the team aligned,
Thanks to documentation found in-line!
```
